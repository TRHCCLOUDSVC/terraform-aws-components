      <description>Pingdom is a service that tracks the availability (e.g. uptime &amp;amp; downtime) as well as the performance of websites. It’s been around for ages and is a tried-and-true method for being alerted when there’s an outage. They also have a feature called “Real User Monitoring” that uses a little bit of javascript to determine how fast your pages are loading for real end-users. Real-user-monitoring is essential for catching brown-outs where the site might be “up” but degraded.</description>

      <description>Synthetic monitoring is a style of monitoring that attempts to closely emulate the behavior of an end-user, often by using scripted recordings of web transactions played back through a web browser using plugin like Selenium. The scripts carry out behaviors (such as traversing paths) to simulate an action that a customer or end-user would take on a site. E.g. we highly recommend testing all user registration flows and password reset forms using this methodology.</description>
